<p>I am a palaeobiologist investigating how various environmental, physical, and historical factors drive patterns of deep-time biodiversity. I use a range of statistical tools and phylogenetic comparative methods alongside fossil occurrence databases and general circulation models to investigate topics such as: <span style="color: #FFA500">(1)</span> the influence of climate on dinosaur evolution; <span style="color: #FFA500">(2)</span> the impact of sampling biases on terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity through deep-time; and <span style="color: #FFA500">(3)</span> ethical issues and the legacy of colonalism in palaeontologial research.

<br><br>

Currently, I am based at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in Germany, where I contribute to teaching on the  <a href="https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/">" International Masters in Paleobiology</a>. If you are a perspective student looking to pursue a career in paleobiology, please do get in touch!
