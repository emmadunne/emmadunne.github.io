I am a palaeobiologist interested in the evolution and biodiversity of vertebrates through deep time. I am particularly interested in how past climate change impacted these creatures, and how this can help us better understand the long-term impacts of the current climate and biodiversity crisis.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Some of my current work includes investigating how past climate change played a role in dinosaur evolution, examining how sampling biases can impact our understanding deep time biodiversity patterns, and performing data-driven analyses of how ethical issues and the legacy of colonialism influence palaeontological research.

I am currently an Akademische Rätin at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in Erlangen, Germany. Here, I teach courses on both the <a href="https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/"> International Masters in Paleobiology</a> and the <a href="https://www.gzn.nat.fau.eu/"> Bachelors in Geoscience (Bachelor Geowissenschaften)</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I also co-lead the <a href="https://paleoscientometrics.github.io/"> Pal(a)eoscientometrics</a> Research Collective, an enterprise that comprises an international and interdisciplinary group of early career scholars and focuses on quantitatively interrogating how history and colonialism shape palaeontological research and our understanding of Earth history</a>.
