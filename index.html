I am a quantitative palaeobiologist and my research aims to understand how environmental, geological, and anthropogenic (human) factors have shaped biodiversity through deep-time. 

I am particularly interested in understanding how past climate change impacted vertebrate creatures (especially amphibians and reptiles), and how looking at past patterns can help us better understand the long-term impacts of the current climate crisis on Earth's biodiversity.

Some of my current work includes investigating how past climate change played a role in dinosaur evolution, examining how sampling biases can impact our understanding deep time biodiversity patterns, and performing data-driven analyses of how ethical issues and the legacy of colonialism influence palaeontological research.

I co-lead the <a href="https://paleoscientometrics.github.io/"> Pal(a)eoscientometrics</a> Research Collective, an enterprise that comprises an international and interdisciplinary group of early career scholars and focuses on quantitatively interrogating how history and colonialism shape palaeontological research and our understanding of Earth history</a>.
