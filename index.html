I am a paleobiologist interested in understanding the drivers that shaped animal evolution and biodiversity through deep time. I ask questions at big scales, in both time and space, taking advantage of the increasing availability of analtyical tools and big paleontological and scientometric datasets. Some of my work has included investigating how past climate change played a role in dinosaur evolution, examining how sampling biases can impact our understanding deep time biodiversity patterns, and performing data-driven analyses of how ethical issues and the legacy of colonialism influence paleontological research.

For more information about both my current and past projects, see the Research page!
