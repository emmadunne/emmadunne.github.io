<br><br>
I am a palaeobiologist at the University of Birmingham and my work is broadly focused on how past environmental changes influenced the biodiversity of fossil vertebrates.
<br><br>
My current research, funded by the Leverhulme Trust, focuses on how past climate change impacted the evolution, diversity, and global distribution of dinosaurs and their kin throughout the Mesozoic (251â€“66 million years ago). Underpinning my work is fossil occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database, to which I apply a range of quantitative and phylogenetic methods.
<br><br>
I am also interested in the human factors that influence fossil occurrence data, including how neocolonialism and imperialism impact research practices in palaeontology.
