I am a quantitative palaeobiologist, working to understand how past environmental changes have impacted the evolution and diversity of fossil vertebrates. I am also interested in how variation in fossil sampling and human (socio-economic) factors can influence these patterns, as well as how deep time investigations can contribute to our understanding of future biodiversity trends.

<br><br>

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Birmingham, UK, investigating how past climate change impacted dinosaur evolution and diversity (supported by the Leverhulme Trust). My previous research has included deep time latitudinal biodiversity gradients, early tetrapod biogeography, and early archosaurian morpholology.

<br><br>

Most of my work is based in R, and I am experienced with phylogenetic comparative methods, sampling standardisation, mixed effects models and network biogeography approaches. My work would not be possible without the <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/">Paleobiology Database</a>, a community resource documenting fossil occurrences from across the globe. 

<br><br>

I am deeply passionate about improving research practices in palaeontology, which to date has included uncovering and documenting ethical issues and the legacy of colonalism in palaeontologial research. I am also a highly experienced science communicator and regularly work with <a href="https://thebrilliantclub.org/">The Brilliant Club</a>, an educational charity working to increase the number of underrepresented pupils progressing to highly-selective universities.
