My research aims to understand how various environmental, physical, anthropogenic, and historical factors drive patterns of deep-time biodiversity. I use a range of statistical approaches, phylogenetic comparative methods, and scientometric tools, alongside fossil occurrence databases and general circulation models to investigate topics such as: (1) the influence of climate on dinosaur evolution; (2) the impact of temporal and spatial sampling biases on terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity through deep time; and (3) scientometric trends and the legacy of colonialism in palaeontological research. 

<br><br>

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Birmingham, UK, investigating how past climate change impacted dinosaur evolution and diversity (supported by the Leverhulme Trust). My previous research has included deep time latitudinal biodiversity gradients, early tetrapod biogeography, and early archosaurian morpholology. More recently I have been investigating scientometric trends in palaeontological research, and how the legacy of colonilism impacts current practices within the discipline.

Most of my work is based in R, and I am experienced with sampling standardisation, phylogenetic comparative methods, mixed effects models and network biogeography approaches. My research would not be possible without data from the <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/">Paleobiology Database</a>, a community resource documenting fossil occurrences from across the globe, which I actively contribute to. 

<br><br>

I am deeply passionate about improving research practices in palaeontology, which to date has included uncovering and documenting ethical issues and the legacy of colonalism in palaeontologial research. I am also a highly experienced science communicator and regularly work with <a href="https://thebrilliantclub.org/">The Brilliant Club</a>, an educational charity working to increase the number of underrepresented pupils progressing to highly-selective universities.
