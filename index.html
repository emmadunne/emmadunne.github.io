<p>I am a paleobiologist interested in understanding the drivers that shaped animal evolution and biodiversity through deep time. I ask questions at big scales, in both time and space, taking advantage of the increasing availability of analtyical tools and big paleontological and scientometric datasets. Some of my work has included investigating how past climate change played a role in dinosaur evolution, examining how sampling biases can impact our understanding deep time biodiversity patterns, and performing data-driven analyses of how ethical issues and the legacy of colonialism influence paleontological research. 

I am currently an Akademische Rätin (Assistant professor) at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in Erlangen, Germany. Previously, I worked at the University of Birmingham, UK for my PhD (supported by the European Research Council) and postdoc (supported by the Leverhulme Trust). I earned my MSc at Imperial College London and the Natural History Museum, and my BA(Mod.) in Zoology from Trinity College Dublin.
