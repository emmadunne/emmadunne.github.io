<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a paleobiologist interested in understanding the drivers that shaped animal evolution and biodiversity through deep time. I ask questions at big scales, in both time and space, taking advantage of the increasing availability of analtyical tools and big paleontological and scientometric datasets.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Some of my work has included investigating how past climate change played a role in dinosaur evolution, examining how sampling biases can impact our understanding deep time biodiversity patterns, and performing data-driven analyses of how ethical issues and the legacy of colonialism influence paleontological research. For more information about my current research interests, see the Research tab!

I am currently an Akademische Rätin (Assistant professor) at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in Erlangen, Germany. Here, I teach courses on both the <a href="https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/"> Masters in Paleobiology & Climate and Earth Systems</a> and the <a href="https://www.gzn.nat.fau.eu/"> Bachelors in Geoscience</a>. So, if you are a prospective or current student interested in working together, please get in touch!
