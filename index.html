<br>

I am a palaeobiologist who investigates how various environmental, physical, anthropogenic, and historical factors drive patterns of deep-time biodiversity. I use a range of statistical approaches, phylogenetic comparative methods, and scientometric tools, alongside fossil occurrence databases and general circulation models to investigate topics such as: <span style="color: #ff0000">(1)</span> the influence of climate on dinosaur evolution; (2) the impact of temporal and spatial sampling biases on terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity through deep time; and (3) scientometric trends and the legacy of colonialism in palaeontological research. 

<br><br>

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Birmingham, UK, supported by the Leverhulme Trust. Most of my work is based in R, and I am experienced with sampling standardisation, phylogenetic comparative methods, mixed effects models and network biogeography approaches. My research would not be possible without data from the <a href="https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/">Paleobiology Database</a>, a community resource documenting fossil occurrences from across the globe, which I actively contribute to. 

<br><br>

I am deeply passionate about improving research practices in palaeontology, which to date has included uncovering and documenting ethical issues and the legacy of colonalism in palaeontologial research. I am also a highly experienced science communicator and regularly work with <a href="https://thebrilliantclub.org/">The Brilliant Club</a>, an educational charity working to increase the number of underrepresented pupils progressing to highly-selective universities.
