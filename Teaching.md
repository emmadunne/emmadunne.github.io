I currently teach courses on both the [International Masters in Paleobiology](https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/) and the [Bachelors in Geoscience (Bachelor Geowissenschaften)](https://www.gzn.nat.fau.eu/) here at FAU. I also supervise Masters and Bachelors theses on a variety of topics related to my research interests, so if you're a student interested in working together please get in touch!
